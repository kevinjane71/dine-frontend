        <div class="intro">
            <strong>Every year, cafes and restaurants waste billions of dollars in food—money that could be profit.</strong> The average restaurant loses 10-20% of its food budget to waste, while many don't even realize it's happening. DineOpen's smart inventory management system tracks every ingredient, monitors waste patterns, and helps you cut costs dramatically. This guide shows you exactly how to reduce food waste and boost profitability using real-time tracking and AI-powered insights.
        </div>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <h3>10-20% of Food Budget Wasted</h3>
            <p>Most cafes and restaurants lose thousands monthly to food waste from over-ordering, spoilage, and incorrect portions. With DineOpen's inventory tracking, you can reduce this by 40-60%.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Food Waste is Killing Your Profitability</h2>
        <p>Food waste isn't just bad for the environment—it's silently destroying your bottom line. Here's what's happening in most cafes and restaurants:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Over-ordering:</strong> Without real-time inventory visibility, you order more than you need, leading to spoilage.</li>
            <li><strong>Expiry tracking failures:</strong> Items expire before use because there's no system to alert you.</li>
            <li><strong>Portion inconsistency:</strong> Staff serve different portions, wasting ingredients and reducing profit margins.</li>
            <li><strong>No waste visibility:</strong> You don't know what's being wasted, why, or how much it costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual tracking errors:</strong> Spreadsheets and paper logs miss waste events, hiding the real problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="problem-box">
            <h3>⚠️ The Hidden Cost</h3>
            <p>For a cafe serving 200 customers daily, food waste can cost ₹15,000-30,000 per month. That's ₹1.8-3.6 lakhs per year walking straight into the trash. <strong>Most owners don't even know it's happening</strong> because they're not tracking waste systematically.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Real-Time Inventory Tracking: Know What You Have, Always</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Track Every Ingredient in Real-Time</h3>
